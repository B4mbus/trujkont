# It's a trujkont

# Compilation

`just s`/`just setup` to setup the project
`just d`/`just debug` to set a development version
`just r`/`just release` to set a release version
`just c`/`just c` to compile it

If you don't have just, just copy what's in `Justfile` for the respecting commands (e.g. `meson setup build` for `just s`).
