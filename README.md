# Compilation

`just sd` to setup debug version 

`just sr` to setup release version 

`just d` to compile debug version 

`just r` to compile release version

Then run `build_debug/turjnoknt` or `build_release/turjnoknt` for debug and release versions respectively.

If you don't have just, just copy what's in `Justfile` for the respecting commands (e.g. `meson setup build` for `just s`).
